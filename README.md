# Correlated Polaron
These python files do many-electron propagation in a polaron transformed reference frame at T>0. Spectra can be fourier transformed out of the propagation, several other time dependent methods such as TD-CIS are also somehow implemented in here with Numpy. The code requires a set of many-electron integrals dumped from an ab-initio package. 

Several arcane quantum many-body routines are implemented in the code; all sorts of boson correlation functions, automatic Wick's theorem derivations etc. Very much mystery meat. If you have a look and you use something please cite my paper (Parkhill Aspuru-Guzik, JCP 2013)
